Farms  near Helsinki and Vihti were selected for practical reasons. On all farms the study took  place on the same day as the harvest, except for one farm where the field had been  harvested some days before. Samples were placed into plastic bags for weighing.  Wheat samples were sorted with a 2 mm sieve, and field peas were sorted by hand in  order to remove inventory obsolescence. To confirm the results, the weighing was  done with a calibrated scale. Samples were converted into a dry matter due to  comparability of the results.",Controlled Experiment,FoodLossPrimaryProd.pdf,,

The reduction in the weight could also be due to moisture  losses from the grains during storage as well as pest and  insect infestations.,"The research was conducted at Nobewam and Besease in the  Ejisu-Juabeng District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana between  2009 and 2010.  Survey  The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest  losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng  District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured  questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception  about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice  farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti  region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest  losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other  important information collected included the causes of postharvest  losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.  Field experiment  Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by  farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4  x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications  per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land  clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and  transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,  dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that  were involved at each stage.  Experimental design  A 2 x 2 RCBD was used comprising 2 varieties (Nerica 1 and Nerica  2) and 2 harvesting methods (panicle and sickle) for determining  harvesting losses. The experimental design for milling yield was 2 x  3 CRD comprising 2 varieties and 3 milling machines.",Controlled Experiment,"Appiah F1*, Guisse R1 and Dartey P. K.

6060,288,113,Rice,2011,32.855,13.01 -52.7%,,Milling,Processing,,"The results of the milling analysis have been presented in  Table 6. The results showed that SB30 had marginally  higher milling yield (67.32%) than SB10 (66%).  However, the differences between the milling yields of  either the SB30 machine and the locally manufactured  milling machine or that of the SB10 machine and the  locally manufactured milling machine were significant.  The locally manufactured milling machine had the lowest  milling yield (63.33%). This implies that the locally  manufactured milling machine was less efficient as it also  resulted in higher percentage (52.7%) of broken grains  (Table 6). This implies that the local machine produced  less white rice per unit weight of paddy. This resulted in  less recoverable rice and therefore less revenue. SB30 is therefore superior to both SB10 and the Local machine in  terms of milling yield. In spite of the higher milling yield of  SB30, it is still lower than the 67.5% (2010 data)  considered to the lowest on record in the USA (Robinson,  2010). According to the author, this could lead to a shift  to selling more broken grains, consequently mean lower  prices. Norman and Otoo (2003) recommended that  improved dehulling and whitening machines should be  developed and tested for use in rice processing","Table 7. Effect of milling machine type on grain breakages.      The research was conducted at Nobewam and Besease in the  Ejisu-Juabeng District in the Ashanti Region of Ghana between  2009 and 2010.  Survey  The survey on farmers’ perception and knowledge of postharvest  losses of rice was conducted at Besease in the Ejisu Juabeng  District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. A semi structured  questionnaire aimed at investigating some rice farmer’s perception  about postharvest losses of rice was administered to thirty rice  farmers in “Besease” a rice farming community in the Ashanti  region of Ghana. Information on farmers’ perception of postharvest  losses and methods of reducing such losses was collected. Other  important information collected included the causes of postharvest  losses, the estimation of postharvest losses.  Field experiment  Two rice varieties, Nerica 1 and Nerica 2, commonly grown by  farmers were grown for assessment. For each variety, an area of 4  x 5 m was demarcated for cultivation. There were three replications  per variety. Cultural practices carried out on the field included land  clearing, ploughing, retovation, raising nursery for seedlings and  transplanting. At maturity the crops were, harvested, threshed,  dried, stored and milled to determine the postharvest losses that  were involved at each stage.  Experimental design  A 2 x 2 RCBD was used comprising 2 varieties (Nerica 1 and Nerica  2) and 2 harvesting methods (panicle and sickle) for determining  harvesting losses.

Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”  21 International Journal of Research in Agriculture and Forestry V2 ● I6 ● June 2015  Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980).

(2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al.

Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al.

The wheat grain losses are classified as i) pre-harvest grain loss due to  the birds, rodents and environmental; ii) harvest grain loss during harvesting of the crop; and iii) postharvest grain loss due to bundling, transporting, threshing and winnowing.  Muhammad Sattar et al. “Grain Losses of Wheat as Affected by Different Harvesting and Threshing  Techniques”  21 International Journal of Research in Agriculture and Forestry V2 ● I6 ● June 2015  Harvesting losses with manual wheat harvesting varied from 3 to 7% after ripening of the crop  (Iqbalet al., 1980). Similarly Ibupotoet al. (1991) investigated that average grain losses for traditional  methods during pre-harvest, harvest and post harvest stages were 10.9, 29 and 122.9 kg ha-1  or 0.28%,  0.77% and 3.28%, respectively whereas, Zafarullah (1985) observed 2.1% total manual harvesting  losses. Singh et al. (1988) tested three tractor front mounted reapers, manufactured locally by FMI,  AMRI and Ittefaq on wheat crop in Pakistan. The wheat grain losses with these reapers were 1.19,  2.63 and 2.76%, respectively. Sukhbiret al. (2007) compared the performance of reaper with  conventional method of manual harvesting of wheat crop with sickle to see the feasibility. They  recorded 5.8% to 11.8% harvesting losses with reaper. Basavarajaet al. (2007) concluded that grain  losses during harvesting and threshing activity of wheat were 0.36 kg/q and 0.44 kg/q, respectively.  Bukhariet al. (1983) found that the average grain losses during conventional harvesting, bundling,  transporting, threshing, winnowing and cleaning were 3.67, 3.98, 0.24, 1.18, 2.46, and 4.53%,  respectively    Chaudhry (1979) estimated 2.01 and 1.2% grain  losses on account of tractor threshing and combine, respectively. The combine harvester not only  minimizes the post-harvest losses but also helps in shortening the harvesting period. Shamabadi  (2012) while evaluating the performance of eight combines observed that time of harvesting, seed  moisture content, relative humidity, field topography and varietal characteristics are the major factors  affecting harvest losses. He concluded that mean total loss by different combines was 6.88% at wheat  harvesting stage. Mirasi et al. (2013) measured grain losses of different wheat varieties with different  models of combine during harvest stage. They observed that average pre harvest losses in all fields of  study were 31.4 kg ha-1  accounting for 12.71 percent of total losses. Bala et al. (1980) also reported  4.09% grain losses of wheat by traditional methods of harvesting and threshing. AMRI (1987) found  2.2% wheat losses for combine as compared to 4.65% for reapers and about 7.5% for manual  harvesting. Begum et al. (2012) found 0.51 kg/quintal grain losses of wheat during the threshing  activity. They concluded that threshing losses were mainly in the form of broken grains. They  observed 2.35 kg/quintal post-harvest losses at farm level. The harvesting losses have added up to  about 40.85 per cent.    .
